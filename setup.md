# Setup
These setup instructions assume you are working on Windows.

## TI-Basic Editor
TI-Basic source code files can have any extension, for example `.txt`. Any text editor will do to 
    edit programs, but we recommend using [TokenIDE](http://merthsoft.com/Tokens.zip).

## Connectivity Software
You will need to connect to your calculator to transfer your newly made programs. We recommend the
    official [TI Connect Software](https://education.ti.com/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw).

## Calculator emulator
If you don't want to use your calculator immediately or don't have one at hand, you can use an 
    emulator on your PC, for example [Wabbitemu](http://wabbitemu.org/).
